### nerd shit

**univalency** is written entirely in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), using
the [Helm](http://helm-engine.org/) game engine. Helm uses a style referred to
as "functionally reactive programming" (FRP) and is inspired directly by the
[Elm programming language](http://elm-lang.org/) (although Elm was certainly not
the first to do so-called FRP).

[Elm's website gives perhaps the best explanation of FRP](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/),
*without* using 20 pages of LaTeX-heavy, dense, technical prose filled with
strange sterile examples that don't seem to mean anything unless you've spent
years of your life saturated in category and intuitionistic type theory.
